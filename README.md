# phpmysql-crud

This is an example of a CRUD site built using PHP, MYSQL, and Bootstrap. The features in this site are user login & registration, photo upload, delete, and edit for the title and description for the photo. 

# notes

I created this site because i didn't really understand how to use framework to create websites. That is why i created my own framework for this website.

# file structure

There are 3 core file for the framework. The model file, the initiator file, and the view file. I put the model file in class folder, initiator and the view are stored directly in the repository.
